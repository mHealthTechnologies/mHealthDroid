Owing to that, it is necessary to create an intermediate driver for every portable biomedical device to be used which will work between the device and the framework. The drivers are included in the framework and remain unnoticed to the user. Thanks to this approach, an application can run simultaneously with different kinds of devices, providing a great flexibility.\r\n\r\nAndroid target version: 4.2\r\n\r\nAndroid minimum version: 2.3.3\r\n\r\n**Table of Contents**\r\n\r\n- [What is mHealthDroid?](#what-is-mhealthdroid)\r\n- [Features.

Import the project to Eclipse or other IDE.    \r\n\r\n2. Add the following libraries:\r\n\r\n    - GraphView 3.0.jar\r\n    - Guava 14.0.jar\r\n    - Shimmer.jar\r\n    - WekaSTRIPPED.jar\r\n    - YouTubeAndroidPlayerApi.jar\r\n\r\n3. Select mHealthDroid as library project.\r\n\r\n4. Creates your new project and select mHealthDroid as library. \r\n\r\n5. Coding time!\r\n\r\nAll the libraries can be downloaded from our following repository: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mHealthDroid/libraries\r\n\r\n## mHealthDroid structure\r\n\r\n<img src=http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/frameworkdiagram.png?w=800 />\r\n\r\nIn the figure is shown the framework structure, with all the existing managers and how they interact with each other. All these managers are Singleton, which means that only exist one unique instance of each and this instance is available from every point of the framework. In short, is described each manager aim. More details of every manager and its development in our website soon.\r\n\r\n- **Communication Manager**: heart of mHealthDroid. It is responsible for, among other things, the communication management with the biomedical devices, the data streaming, the local data storage and the broadcast of the received data to the rest of the framework.\r\n- **Remote Storage Manager**: is aim is to upload the data avalaible in the local database to a remote storage. Although the framework only comprises the client side of the communication, it has also been offered a possible implementation to be used on the remote storage side to manage the received data from apps developed with _mHealthDroid_.\r\n- **Visualization Manager**: allow either online or offline visualization. It has been developed using the GraphView library (http://android-graphview.org/). The source code of the compatible version for this library can be found in the following repository https://github.com/mHealthDroid/myGraphView\r\n- **Data Processing Manager**: a really powerful manager, responsible for processing data and applying knowledge inference, either orline or offline.\r\n- **System Manager**: miscellaneous manager which offers easy management of instrinsic aspect of Android devices; guidelines functionalities specially useful for health applications; and send alerts.\r\n\r\n## Full documentation\r\n\r\nThe full documentation of mHealthDroid can be found in both authors master thesis, either <a href=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/full-documentation-thesis-rafael-garcia.pdf\">here</a> (Rafael Garcia) or <a href=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/full-documentation-thesis-alejandro-saez.pdf\">here</a> (Alejandro Saez). Both documents are the same apart from Chapter 1 (Introduction), Chapter 2 (State of the Art) and Chapter 5 (Conclusions). In these document, mHealthDroid development is fully explained. The managers chapters are comprised of the following sections: <em>Description</em>, where every manager, its functionalities and its development is fully described; <em> How to use it </em>, which aim is to show basic examples of how to use each manager and its content is the same than the following section in this readme; and <em> Difficulties and solutions applied </em>, which explains some problems we bumped into during the mHealthDroid development and how we solve them.\r\n\r\n## mHealthDroid APP\r\n\r\nThis exemplary APP demonstrates the usefulness and potential of mHealthDroid. It is important to point out that there was no effort to implement its functionalities thanks to mHealthDroid simplicity (we spent the most of the developing time in the app visual appearance). It can be found in Google Play by the name of mHealthDroid APP or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mHealthDroid.activitydetector&hl=es_419\">here</a>.\r\n\r\n### Main Features\r\n\r\n- The app allows to collect data from Shimmer devices in order to obtain physiological and kinematic data, although existing sensors in the mobile device may be also used for monitoring. \r\n- Visualization of any of the received data streams from the portable biomedical devices.\r\n- Local and remote storage of the collected data. \r\n- Activity Recognition of the physical activity that an app user is performing thanks to an expert system built as part of the app.\r\n- To help the user to keep healthy habits, guidelines are supported through online video broadcasting and schedulable notifications.\r\n\r\n### Demostration Video\r\n\r\nIn the following video the mHealthDroid APP and all its functionalities are shown: \r\n\r\n[<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/thumbnailvideo.png?w=673\" height=300>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMdxw4osjCU)\r\n\r\n### APP Usage\r\n\r\nIt is possible to navigate around the app making use of the available tabs in the top of the screen. Each tab offers a functionality for the following: Connectivity, Visualization, Activity Recognition, Remote Storage, Notifications Manager and YouTube Guidelines.\r\n\r\n#### Connectivity\r\n\r\nThis tab offers to the user all the connectivity features and the devices configuration. The tab has a Button to add the new devices, and a ListView to visualize them.\r\n\r\nIn order to add a new device, the \"Plus\" Button must be pressed. Then, a message will be thrown asking for the device name. The message also have two buttons in order to select the kind of device. It can be either *Mobile* or *Shimmer*.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/connectivity1.png?w=253\" height=300>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/addingdevice1.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/scanning.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n\r\nOnce the device is added, it will be displayed in the ListView. It is showed three fields for each device: The first one is the device's name, the second one is the device's type, and the third one is its state. The state is represented by a coloured circle. It will be red when the device is disconnected, orange when the device is streaming, or green when the device is connected but not streaming.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/errorinsertion11.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/errorinsertion21.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/devicesstatus1.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n\r\nWhen a device is pressed, a menu with several options is displayed. These options will depend on the device's type and its status. The possible options are the following ones:\r\n\r\n- *Connect/Disconnect*. With this option, the device is either connected (if it was disconnected) or disconnected (if it was connected). Since the mobile device does not need to be connected or disconnected, this function is only available for Shimmer devices.\r\n- *Start/Stop streaming*. With this option, the device either starts or stops streaming.\r\n- *Sensors*. This option throws a window to set the enabled sensors. The sensors available can be different for each kind of device. It is only showed when the device is not streaming.\r\n- *Configuration*. This option opens a window to set the device configuration. Here, it is also set whether the data must be stored into the database. The device configuration can be different for each kind of device. It is only showed when the device is not streaming.\r\n- *Remove*. This option removes a device from the devices list.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/menumobile1.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/menumobilestreaming1.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/menushimmerconnected1.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/menushimmerstreaming.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/sensorsmobile.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/shimmersensors.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/mobileconfiguration.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/shimmerconfiguration.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Visualization\r\n\r\nThis tab permits to visualize the signals recorded through the sensors. The tab is composed by a graph and two buttons: the *Configuration* button and the *Start* button.\r\n\r\nWhen the *Configuration* button is pressed, a menu is open in order to set the graph configurations. The options are initially disabled (the graph has a configuration by default). These have to be enabled in order to use them. The configuration menu is not available during the visualization, so the graph must be set before starting. The configuration options are the following ones:\r\n\r\n- *View Port*. This option sets the graph view port. That is, the number of samples to be shown in the graph. \r\n- *Y coordinates*. This option sets the maximum and minimum values for the Y axis. \r\n- *Legend*. This option shows the legend of the graph series. It can be aligned in three different positions. On the top of the graph, in the middle, or at the bottom.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/visualization.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/visualizationinit.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/visualizationconfiguration1.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/visualizationconfiguration2.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n\r\nWhen the Start button is pressed, a list of devices streaming is showed in order to select the device to be visualized. In case there are no devices streaming, an error message will be showed. When a device is selected, it is displayed a list with the device enabled sensors. When the device sensors to visualize are selected, and the OK button is pressed, the visualization starts.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/devicesvisualization1.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/deviceandsensors1.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/deviceandsensors21.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/errorvisualization1.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n\r\n#### Activity Recognition\r\n\r\nThis tab uses inference knowledge module to perform activity recognition of a set of activities.  \r\n\r\nThe activities are the following: standing still, sitting and relaxing, lying down, walking, climbing stairs, waist bends forward, frontal (vertical) up/down, knees bended, cycling, jogging, running, jump forward and back.\r\n\r\nIn order to perform the activity recognition, some wearable devices must be placed around our body, as it shown in the next figure:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/subjectsensors.png?w=601\" height = 375>\r\n\r\nTo start the activity recognition, it is necessary to set each connected device to its position in the body (chest, right wrist or left ankle). For this purpose there are three spinners on the screen, one for each position. Once this is done, the button start is used to begin the activity recognition. On the top of the screen there will appear an image and text representing the activity which the app user is performing. In case there are no devices streaming, an error message will be showed.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/activityspinner1.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/activitystart1.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/erroractivity1.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/activityrecognition1.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/running-activity.png?w=346\" height = 280>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/jogging-activity.png?w=337\" height = 280>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/cycling-activity.png?w=346\" height = 280>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/walking-activity.png?w=337\" height = 280>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/up-down-activity.png?w=338\" height = 280>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/waist-bends-activity.png?w=337\" height = 280>\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Notifications\r\n\r\nThis tab permits to create different kind of notifications. When the tab is selected, it appears a form that it must be filled in order to create the notification. This field is composed:\r\n\r\n- *Title*. Title of the notification.\r\n- *Description*. Full description text of the notification.\r\n- *Sound*. A field where three different sounds may be selected to be reproduced when the notification is launched: Alarm, Ringtone and Notification sounds. There is also the possibility of set this sound to \"None\".    \r\n- *Launch Recommendations*. It is a checkbox that in the case of being checked, when the notification is clicked the YouTube guidelines is launched.\r\n- *Schedule Notification*. It allows for the scheduling the notification to a specified date and time.\r\n\r\nAs an example, it can be used an app user with back problems that needs to be reminded about his daily exercises. Thus, for this purpose, the user can create a notification and customize it by putting the notification title and description, as well as setting the hour of its appearance. Moreover, if the user wants to visualize some recommended exercises he can mark the *Launch Recommendations* option that after clicking on the notification will automatically open the YouTube Guidelines tab.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/notifications1.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/notifications2.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/notifications3.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/notifications4.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/notifications5.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/notifications6.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n\r\n#### YouTube Guidelines\r\n\r\nThis tab allows the app user the visualization of videos in order to keep healthy habits or learn new exercises with physical therapy purposes. There are five different playlists that can be selected by the user using the button *Playlists*:\r\n\r\n- General Health: playlist about how to keep healthy daily habits and how to maintain a healthy diet.\r\n- Knee: playlist with videos of knee rehabilitation, orientate to user with knee problems.\r\n- Back: playlist with videos of back rehabilitation, orientate to user with back problems.\r\n- Ankle: playlist with videos of ankle rehabilitation, orientate to user with ankle problems.\r\n- Neck: playlist with videos of neck rehabilitation, orientate to user with neck problems.\t\r\n    \r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/youtube1.png?w=253\" height = 350>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/youtube2.png?w=253\" height = 350>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/youtube3.png?w=253\" height = 350>\r\n\r\nOnce that a playlist has been selected, a scrollable list of videos will appear on the screen. This list can be extended pressing on the *Extend List* button and collapse by pressing on it again. When the user selects a video to be reproduced, this appears on the player and can be reproduced when the start icon is clicked. The player may also be extended using the button *Extend Player* or collapse clicking on it again.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/youtube4.png?w=253\" height = 350>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/youtube5.png?w=253\" height = 350>\r\n\r\n#### Remote Storage\r\n\r\nThis tab allows the user app to upload to a remote storage the collected data from the portable biomedical devices. It is composed of a list with every of the available devices in the app and a button to set the WiFi connection (for the sake of simplicity, since 3G connection can be used as well).\r\n\r\nWhen a device of the list is pressed on, it appears a dialog asking the app user to define which tables must be uploaded. There are three options: Units, Metadata and Signals. After pressing the OK button the uploading of the selected data starts. A message will appear in the screen to notify the end of the uploading process.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/remote1.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/remote2.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/remote3.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n<img src=\"http://apuestasrafag.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/remote4.png?w=253\" height = 300>\r\n\r\n## Examples. How to use mHealthDroid\r\n\r\nThe aim of this section is to show basic examples of how to use each manager. More detailed information will be coming soon.\r\n\r\n### Communication Manager\r\n\r\nEvery manager is singleton, which means it is necessary to get its instance like this:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\nCommunicationManager cm = CommunicationManager.getInstance();\r\n```\r\nThen, if one wants to storage data into the database, the variable storage must be initialized this way:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\ncm.CreateStorage(getApplicationContext());\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo add devices to the manager, one just needs to call the appropriate functions:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\ncm.AddDeviceShimmer(getApplicationContext(), \"Device Shimmer\", true);\r\ncm.AddDeviceMobile(getApplicationContext(), \"Mobile Device\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the mobile device uses the device's sensor, it is not necessary to connect it. But\r\nfor the Shimmer devices, once they have been added, they need to be connected. This\r\nwork is done by the function _Connect_, giving as parameter the mac address:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\ncm.connect(\"Device Shimmer\", address);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore the device starts to stream, the enabled sensors of the devices can be set:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\nArrayList<SensorType> sensors = newArrayList<SensorType>();\r\nsensors.add(SensorType.ACCELEROMETER);\r\nsensors.add(SensorType.MAGNETOMETER);\r\nsensors.add(SensorType.GYROSCOPE);\r\ncm.writeEnabledSensors(\"Mobile Device\", sensors);\r\ncm.writeEnabledSensors(\"Device Shimmer\", sensors);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe number of samples to be stored in the buffer can be chosen too:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\ncm.setNumberOfSampleToStorage(100);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter all these things are done, it is the suitable moment to start (and stop whenever\r\nis wanted) to stream:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\ncm.startStreaming(\"Mobile Device\");\r\ncm.startStreaming(\"Device Shimmer\");\r\ncm.stopStreaming(\"Mobile Device\");\r\ncm.stopStreaming(\"Device Shimmer\");\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThere are a couple of features that can be set either before or during the data streaming\r\nsuch as to select what device is going to store its data (by default, it is set to true) or to set a label.\r\n\r\n``` java\r\ncm.setStoreData(\"Mobile Device\", false);\r\ncm.setStoreData(\"device Shimmer\", true);\r\ncm.setLabel(\"walking\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is a way to get the device in case it is wanted to access to its specific functionalities:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\nDeviceShimmerdS = (DeviceShimmer) cm.getDevice(\"Device Shimmer\");\r\nDeviceMobiledM = (DeviceMobile) cm.getDevice(\"Mobile Device\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo insert a new users profile there are a couple of things to consider. The database\r\nmust be open and the table created. It is also possible to check whether the login\r\nalready exists in order to avoid a SQL exception. Then the database should be closed.\r\nAll of this is possible by doing:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\ncm.openDatabase();\r\ncm.createUsersTable();\r\nif(!cm.existsLogin(login))\r\n\tcm.addUserProfile(login, password, age, sex, weight, height, email);\r\nelse\r\n\tToast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), \"this login already exists\",Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();\r\ncm.closeDatabase();\r\n```\r\nIn case there are devices streaming, it is advisable to check whether any of them store\r\ndata before closing the database. It should be done in order to avoid a SQL exception.\r\nTo do that, it is only necessary to call the function of the Communication Manager\r\nnamed _isStoring()_:\r\n``` java\r\nif(!cm.isStoring())\r\n\tcm.closeDatabase();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Remote Storage Manager\r\n\r\nThe way to use this module is quite simple. RemoteStorageManager is a singleton class (class instantiation restricted to one object), so to obtain a RemoteStorageManager instance is necessary to proceed as follows:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\nServerManager sm = ServerManager.getInstance();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is also necessary to initialize the Storage variable belonging to the RemoteStorageManager class called storage. This is done by:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\nsm.CreateStorage(getApplicationContext());\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the server IP address is set by means of the function _setServerIP_. Also, it\r\nis compulsory to set the name and path (if necessary) of the scripts that will be executed in the server side. These scripts must be accessible from the server IP address.\r\nFor example, using XAMPP like in this example the scripts inside the _Htdocs_ can be\r\naccessible by the address _http://serverIP/scriptName_.\r\n\r\n``` java\r\nsm.setServerIP(\"http://192.168.1.11\");\r\nsm.setMobileMetadataPath(\"insert_mobile_metadata.php\");\r\nsm.setMobileSignalsPath(\"insert_mobile_signals.php\");\r\nsm.setMobileUnitsPath(\"insert_mobile_units.php\");\r\nsm.setShimmerMetadataPath(\"insert_shimmer_metadata.php\");\r\nsm.setShimmerSignalsPath(\"insert_shimmer_signals.php\");\r\nsm.setShimmerUnitsPath(\"insert_shimmer_units.php\");\r\nsm.setLastIDPath(\"get_last_ID.php\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf WiFi connection is used, WiFi must be enabled. The user can turn it on through\r\nthe setWiFiEnabled function defined on the System Manager.\r\n\r\n``` java\r\nsysm.setWifiEnabled(true, getApplicationContext());\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are three functions for uploading, one for each database table: data, metadata\r\nor units. For example, the uploading of the the database tables for the mobile device\r\n(\"Mobile device\") and the ones for a given wearable monitoring device (\"device 1\") is\r\ndefined as follows:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\n// To upload shimmer tables\r\nsm.uploadUnitsTable(\"device 1\");\r\nsm.uploadMetadataTable(\"device 1\");\r\nsm.uploadSignalsTable(\"device 1\");\r\n\r\n// To upload mobile tables\r\nsm.uploadUnitsTable(\"Mobile Device\");\r\nsm.uploadMetadataTable(\"Mobile Device\");\r\nsm.uploadSignalsTable(\"Mobile Device\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo know when the data are upload, it is needed to run within a thread the function\r\nisProcessFinished(). An example of how to do this follows:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\nHandler mHandler = new Handler();\r\nmHandler.post(isFinished);\r\nRunnable isFinished = new Runnable(){\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic void run() {\r\n\t\tif(rsm.isProcessFinished()){\r\n\t\t\tToast.makeText(getActivity(), \"Uploading completed\", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();\r\n}\r\n\t\telse\r\n\t\t\tmHandler.postDelayed(this, 1000);\r\n\t}\r\n};\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce all the data are uploaded, the thread responsible for the uploading must be\r\nstopped, to save the waste of resources.\r\n\r\n``` java\r\nsm.finishProcess();\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo finish, according to users preferences, the WiFi connection could be turn off.\r\n``` java\r\nsysm.setWifiEnabled(false, getApplicationContext());\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo upload the local database, some PHP scripts are necessaries, provided along\r\nwith the framework. It is just a simple implementation, different scripts could be used, but the framework user must be careful with the scripts name and the paths where these are located. By default, if the user does not change scripts names or paths, the files get _last ID.php, DB config.php, insert mobile metadata.php, insert mobile signals.php, insert mobile units.php, insert shimmer metadata.php, insert shimmer signals.php_ and _insert shimmer units.php_ must be located in a path where can be accessible by the address _http://serverIP/nameFile.php_ (for example, in the directory Htdocs for XAMPP).\r\n\r\nConsequently, if the user wants to use different scripts or just for server reasons\r\nneeds to change their path, it can be achieved by means of the following functions: _set-\r\nMobileUnitsPath(String path), setMobileSignalsPath(String path), setMobileMetadata-\r\nPath(String path), setShimmerUnitsPath(String path), setShimmerSignalsPath(String\r\npath), setShimmerMetadataPath(String path)_ and _setLastIDPath(String path)_.\r\n\r\n### Visualization Manager\r\n\r\nSince it is a singleton class, first it is necessary to get the instance:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\nVisualizationManager vm = VisualizationManager.getInstance();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, a graph must be created. A unique name to the graph and its type (Line or\r\nBars) must be selected. The UI context must also be indicated.\r\n\r\n``` java\r\nvm.addGraph(\"graph\", GraphType.LINE, getApplicationContext());\r\n```\r\nNow, it depends on the approach desired, either online or offline. Here, both of them\r\nare explained.\r\n\r\n- Offline\r\n\t\r\n  To create a series, first it is necessary to create an array with the values of the Y\r\ncoordinates. For this example, the Sine of a set of numbers will be used:                  \t\r\n\r\n\t``` java\r\n\tfloat[] array = new float[250];\r\n\tfloat a = 0;\r\n    for (int i = 0; i < 250; i++) {\r\n\t\ta += 0.2;\r\n\t\tarray[i] = (float) Math.sin(a);\r\n\t}\r\n\t```\r\n    \r\n    To introduce the data into the graph, the following procedure must be used:\r\n    ``` java\r\nvm.addSerie(\"graph\", \"Sin\", array);\r\n```\r\nor\r\n\r\n  ``` java\r\n  vm.addSerie(\"graph\", \"Sin\", array, Color.BLUE, 1, \"Sin from 0 to 250\");\r\n  ```\r\nA series can be introduced with a description. To show it, one must activate the\r\noption. Its alignment in the graph can be set as well:\r\n``` java\r\nvm.setShowLegend(\"graph\", true);\r\nvm.setLegendAlign(\"graph\", LegendAlign.TOP);\r\n```\r\nThe graph must be included in a layout In order to be painted:\r\n```\r\nLinearLayout layout = (LinearLayout) findViewById(R.id.graph);\r\nvm.paint(\"graph\", layout);\r\n```\r\nHorizontal and vertical labels are created automatically, but they can be set like\r\nthis:\r\n``` java\r\nString [] month = {\"January\", \"February\", \"March\", \"April\", \"May\",\r\n\"June\", \"July\", \"August\", \"Sept.\", \"Oct.\", \"Nov.\", \"Dec.\"};\r\nvm.setHorizontalLabels(\"graph\", month);\r\nvm.setVerticaltalLabels(\"graph\", month);\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Online\r\n\t\r\n    Like in the offine mode, it is necessary to add the graph into a layout:\r\n``` java\r\nLinearLayout layoutOnline = (LinearLayout)\r\nfindViewById(R.id.graphOnline);\r\nvm.paint(\"graph\", layoutOnline);\r\n```\r\nTo visualize online data, it is necessary indicate the set of sensors desired:\r\n``` java\r\nArrayList<SensorType> sensors = new ArrayList<SensorType>();\r\nsensors.add(SensorType.ACCELEROMETER_X);\r\nsensors.add(SensorType.ACCELEROMETER_Y);\r\nsensors.add(SensorType.ACCELEROMETER_Z);\r\nsensors.add(SensorType.GYROSCOPE_X);\r\nsensors.add(SensorType.GYROSCOPE_Y);\r\nsensors.add(SensorType.GYROSCOPE_Z);\r\nsensors.add(SensorType.MAGNETOMETER_X);\r\nsensors.add(SensorType.MAGNETOMETER_Y);\r\nsensors.add(SensorType.MAGNETOMETER_Z);\r\n```\r\nThe _scrollable_ feature of the graph MUST be activated. Otherwise online visualization\r\nwill NOT work:\r\n``` java\r\nvm.setScrollable(\"graph\", true);\r\n```\r\nNow it is the time to use the function, which does all the work, to visualize the\r\ndata:\r\n``` java\r\nvm.visualizationOnline(\"graph\", \"nameDevice\", sensors);\r\n```\r\nTo stop the visualization process, the following method may be used:\r\n``` java\r\nvm.stopVisualizationOnline(\"graph\", \"nameDevice\");\r\n```\r\nThere are some features that are advisable to set in order to get a better visualization\r\nin both modes:\r\n- Make the graph scalable (advisable for offine mode):\r\n``` java\r\nvm.setScalable(\"graph\", true);\r\n```\r\n- Set the init and the viewport (advisable for online mode):\r\n``` java\r\nvm.setViewPort(\"graph\", 1, 200);\r\n```\r\n- Set the values of the Y axis (advisable for both modes):\r\n``` java\r\nvm.setManualYAxisBounds(\"graph\", 10, -10);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### System Manager\r\n\r\nSystem Manager is a singleton class. Thus, to obtain the unique instance that could\r\nexists in an application it is necessary to use the getInstance function.\r\n``` java\r\nSystemManager sm = SystemManager.getInstance();\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Services and Setup\r\n\r\nServices and Setup modules are quite simple to use. To perform a mobile call or to\r\nsend a text message it could be done like follows:\r\n``` java\r\nsm.call(number, activity);\r\nsm.sendSMS(number, message);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere number parameter is the mobile number to call or send a message and\r\nmessage the text message to be sent.\r\nThere are three kind of notifications which can be used as follow:\r\n``` java\r\nsm.sendSimpleNotification(title, text, notificationID, icon, context);\r\nPendingIntent contentIntent =\r\nPendingIntent.getActivity(getApplicationContext(), 0, Intent, 0);\r\nint flags = Notification.FLAG_AUTO_CANCEL;\r\nsm.sendComplexNotification(title, text, notificationId, icon, flags,\r\ncontentIntent, context);\r\nUri soundUri =\r\nRingtoneManager.getDefaultUri(RingtoneManager.TYPE_NOTIFICATION);\r\nsm.sendComplexNotificationCustomSound(title, text, notificationId, icon,\r\nflags, contentIntent, soundUri, context);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere _title_ parameter is the notification title, _text_ the text to be shown, _notificationId_ the notification ID, _icon_ a notification icon and context the application UI\r\ncontext. For the last two notification type, _contentIntent_ is the Intent which is run\r\nwhen the notifications are clicked on and flags parameters are the notifications \r\nflags available for user usage.\r\n\r\n_NOTE. The minimum Android SDK Version required is 10th so some flags belonging\r\nto newer Android SDK versions may do not work properly._\r\n\r\nThese same notifications may be scheduled. It is necessary to declare in the Android\r\nManifest the class ScheduledTask as a receiver.\r\n\r\n``` java\r\n<receiver android:name=\"systemManager.services.ScheduledTask\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nsm.scheduledSimpleNotification(title, text, notificationID, icon, context,\r\ndate);\r\nsm.scheduledComplexNotification(title, text, notificationId, icon, flags,\r\ncontentIntent, context, date);\r\nsm.scheduledComplexNotificationCustomSound(title, text, notificationId, icon,\r\nflags, contentIntent, soundUri, context, date);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll parameters play the same role than explained previously except _Date_. It is a\r\nCalendar type which indicates when the notification is scheduled. It is also possible to\r\nschedule an audio to be reroduced by this:\r\n``` java\r\nsm.scheduledAudio(path, context, date);\r\n```\r\nWhere _path_ is the files path, _context_ is the application UI context and _date_ is a\r\nCalendar type indicating when the audio is scheduled to be reproduced.\r\n\r\nTo turn on/off Wi-Fi or Bluetooth:\r\n``` java\r\nsm.setWifiEnabled(true/false, context);\r\nsm.setBluetooth(true/false);\r\n```\r\nThe first boolean parameter set the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth state and _context_ is the application\r\nUI context. Finally, the screen brightness could be adjust as follows:\r\n``` java\r\nsm.setScreenBrightness(brightness, activity)\r\n```\r\nThe parameter of _brightness_ is a float number between 0 and 1 (from dark to\r\nbright). It is also possible to set it to less than 0, which means that the user default\r\nscreen brightness is used.\r\n\r\n#### Guidelines\r\n\r\nThe manner of using any of the guidelines modules is slightly different. First, it is\r\nnecessary to obtain an instance of the class which will be used and once this is done,\r\njust use its functions.\r\n\r\n##### YouTube\r\n\r\nTo build the YouTube module has been necessary the YouTube Android Player API. To employ this API is compulsory to provide at least a _YoutubePlayerView_. An\r\nexample of how to use the YouTube Guideline module is shown next:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\nsetContentView(R.layout.youtube_layout);\r\nYouTubePlayerViewyoutubeView =\r\n(YouTubePlayerView)findViewById(R.id.youtube_view);\r\nyoutube = sm.getYoutubePlayer(getApplicationContext(), youtubeView, DEVELOPER_KEY);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe developer key is a variable that identifies the YouTube developer submitting\r\nan API request. In the case when only playing a YouTube video is wanted, it could be\r\ndone by:\r\n``` java\r\nyoutube.reproduceSingleVideoMode(URL);\r\n```\r\nThe _URL_ parameter is the YouTube video URL to be reproduced, that consists of\r\nthe last part of the video link.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to reproduce YouTube playlist videos, selecting the video to be\r\nreproduced using a _listView_ view. In order to do this, it is necessary to have in the\r\ncurrent layout a _listView_ view.\r\n``` java\r\nListViewvideosListView = (ListView)findViewById(R.id.listListView);\r\nyoutube.reproducePlaylistMode(videosListView, R.layout.entry, PLAYLIST_URL);\r\n```\r\nThe parameter _entry_ is a layout with every entry format of the _listview_.\r\n\r\n##### Audio\r\n\r\nThe Audio module has been developed using the Media Player Android API.\r\nTo utilize this module, the first thing to do is to obtain an instance of the Audio class.\r\n\r\n``` java\r\nAudio audioPlayer = sm.getAudioPlayer();\r\n```\r\nNow, to play a stored audio file in the mobile phone, this must be done:\r\n``` java\r\nString path = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + \"/\" + \"song.mp3\";\r\naudioPlayer.loadFile(path);\r\naudioPlayer.prepare();\r\naudioPlayer.play();\r\n```\r\nMore functions are available, such as _pause_, _resume_, _getDuration_, etc. However,\r\nevery function of the MediaPlayer API may be used.\r\n\r\n##### Video\r\n\r\nThe Video module is based on the functionality provides by the _VideoView_ view. To reproduce a video which is stored in the mobile external card, the following\r\nshould be done:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\nsetContentView(R.layout.video_layout);\r\nVideoViewvideoHolder = (VideoView)findViewById(R.id.videoView);\r\nVideo video = sm.getVideoPlayer(videoHolder);\r\nString path = Enviroment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + \"/\" + \"video.mp4\";\r\nvideo.setVideoPath(path);\r\nvideo.play();\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore functions are available, such as pause or resume. Every function of the\r\n_VideoView_ class may be used.\r\n\r\n### Data Processing Manager\r\n\r\nSince it is a singleton class, first it is necessary to get the unique instance.\r\n``` java\r\nDataProcessingManager dpm = DataProcessingManager.getInstance();\r\n```\r\nIt is also necessary to initialize and set (for the acquisition module) the Storage\r\nvariable belonging to the RemoteStorageManager class called storage. This is done by:\r\n``` java\r\ndpm.createAndSetStorage(getApplicationContext());\r\n```\r\nNow it proceeds depending on the inference knowledge approach desired: online or\r\noffine.\r\n\r\n#### Offline\r\n\r\n##### Acquisition\r\n    \r\n   To show how the data acquisition is done, some devices and sensors where data\r\nare retrieved must be selected. For example, it is shown how to acquire the signals\r\naccelerometer X, accelerometer Y, accelerometer Z and timestamp of a given wearable\r\ndevice called \"Shimmer Chest\" and the gyroscope X, gyroscope Y, gyroscope Z,\r\nhumidity and timestamp of a portable mobile device called \"Mobile Device\".\r\n\r\n``` java\r\nArrayList<Pair<ArrayList<SensorType>, String>> sensorsAndDevices = new\r\nArrayList<Pair<ArrayList<SensorType>, String>>();\r\nArrayList<SensorType> sensors1 = new ArrayList<SensorType>();\r\nArrayList<SensorType> sensors2 = new ArrayList<SensorType>();\r\nsensors1.add(SensorType.ACCELEROMETER_X);\r\nsensors1.add(SensorType.ACCELEROMETER_Y);\r\nsensors1.add(SensorType.ACCELEROMETER_Z);\r\nsensors1.add(SensorType.TIMESTAMP);\r\nsensors2.add(SensorType.GYROSCOPE_X);\r\nsensors2.add(SensorType.GYROSCOPE_Y);\r\nsensors2.add(SensorType.GYROSCOPE_Z);\r\nsensors2.add(SensorType.HUMIDITY);\r\nsensors2.add(SensorType.TIMESTAMP);\r\nString nameDevice1 = \"Shimmer CHEST\";\r\nString nameDevice2 = \"Mobile Device\";\r\nPair<ArrayList<SensorType>, String> pair1 = new Pair(sensors1, nameDevice1);\r\nPair<ArrayList<SensorType>, String> pair2 = new Pair(sensors2, nameDevice2);\r\nsensorsAndDevices.add(pair1);\r\nsensorsAndDevices.add(pair2);\r\n``` \r\n    \r\n   Now that _sensorsAndDevices_ is ready, any Acquisition function may be used. To\r\nacquire all the selected data in the IDs range 100-500:\r\n``` java\r\ndpm.retrieveInformationByID(100, 500, sensorsAndDevices);\r\n```\r\nTo retrieve data belonging to the first existing session:\r\n``` java\r\ndpm.retrieveBySession(1, sensorsAndDevices);\r\n```\r\nTo retrieve data belonging to the first, second and third session:\r\n``` java\r\ndpm.retrieveInformationByIntervalSessions(1, 3, sensorsAndDevices);\r\n```\r\nTo retrieve the last 20 seconds of available data in the local database:\r\n``` java\r\ndpm.retrieveInformationLastSeconds(20, sensorsAndDevices);\r\n```\r\nRetrieving data using dates is slightly more complicated. An example of retrieving\r\nall the data streamed from the day 24th January 2014 at 22:00:00 hour to the day 25th\r\nJanuary 2014 at 16:00:00 follows. It is important to keep in mind that month value\r\ngoes in the interval [0-11]\r\n``` java\r\nTime start = new Time();\r\nstart.hour = 22;\r\nstart.minute = 0;\r\nstart.second = 0;\r\nstart.year = 2014;\r\nstart.month = 0;\r\nstart.monthDay = 24;\r\nTime end = new Time();\r\nend.hour = 16;\r\nend.minute = 0;\r\nend.second = 0;\r\nend.year = 2014;\r\nend.month = 0;\r\nend.monthDay = 25;\r\ndpm.retrieveInformationByDates(start, end, sensorsAndDevices);\r\n```\r\nTo retrieve all the information available:\r\n``` java\r\ndpm.retrieveAllInformation(sensorsAndDevices);\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Pre-Processing\r\n\r\nFrom this point, it is assumed that the data has been already acquired and stored\r\nin the hash variable (which is defined in this manager). Thus, to calculate either the\r\n_Upsampling_ or the _Downsampling_, one just needs to do the following:\r\n``` java\r\ndpm.downSampling(2);\r\ndpm.upSampling(3);\r\n```\r\nThe result will be stored into the _hashProcessed_ variable, which is defined in this\r\nmanager.\r\n\r\n##### Segmentation\r\n\r\nTo make the segmentation, first it is necessary to get the devices' sample rate. For\r\nthis example, an array with false sample rates is created:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\nArrayList<Float> rates = new ArrayList<Float>();\r\nrates.add((float) 50.0);\r\nrates.add((float) 50.0);\r\nrates.add((float) 50.0);\r\n```\r\nThen, the windowing no overlap can be calculated as follow:\r\n``` java\r\ndpm.windowing_NoOverlap(DataType.Raw, (float) 2, rates);\r\nand the windowing overlap as follow:\r\ndpm.windowing_overlap(DataType.Raw, (float) 2.5, (float) 0.5, rates);\r\n```\r\n##### Features Extraction\r\n\r\nThe features must be defined in order to make the features extraction. These are\r\nsome features definitions:\r\n``` java\r\ndpm.addFeature(\"Device Shimmer 1\", SensorType.ACCELEROMETER_X,\r\nFeatureType.MAXIMUM);\r\ndpm.addFeature(\"Device Shimmer 2\", SensorType.ACCELEROMETER_Y,\r\nFeatureType.MINIMUM);\r\ndpm.addFeature(\"Device Mobile\", SensorType.ACCELEROMETER_Z,\r\nFeatureType.VARIANCE);\r\ndpm.addFeature(\"Device Shimmer 1\", SensorType.GYROSCOPE_Y,\r\nFeatureType.STANDARD_DEVIATION);\r\ndpm.addFeature(\"Device Shimmer 2\", SensorType.MAGNETOMETER_X,\r\nFeatureType.ZERO_CROSSING_RATE);\r\ndpm.addFeature(\"Device Mobile\", SensorType.MAGNETOMETER_Z,\r\nFeatureType.MEAN_CROSSING_RATE);\r\n```\r\nOwing to the previous steps, the features extraction can be done from different data:\r\n\r\n- From not processed data and not segmented:\r\n``` java\r\ndpm.feature_extraction(DataType.Raw, false, false);\r\n```\r\n- From processed data and not segmented:\r\n``` java\r\ndpm.feature_extraction(DataType.Processed, false, false);\r\n```\r\n- From not processed data and segmented:\r\n``` java\r\ndpm.feature_extraction(DataType.Raw, true, false);\r\n```\r\n- From processed and segmented data, using the uncompleted windows:\r\n``` java\r\ndpm.feature_extraction(DataType.Processed, true, true);\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Classification\r\n\r\nThe way to use the Classification module does not change depending on the selected\r\napproach (offine or online). The first thing to do is to read a Weka file (arff format).\r\n\r\n``` java\r\ndpm.readFile(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), \"example.arff\");\r\n```\r\nNow, test or training instances may be set. Also a summary of both train instances\r\nmay be obtained.\r\n``` java\r\ndpm.setTrainInstances();\r\ndpm.setTestInstances();\r\nString TrainSummary = dpm.getTrainInstancesSummary();\r\n```\r\nA model may be built with the _trainClassifier_ function. The first parameter is the\r\nclass attribute and usually is the last attribute. The second parameter is the classifier\r\ntype to be used, in this case J48 (Decision Tree). The _getAttributes_ function returns a\r\nlist of the existing Attributes.\r\n``` java\r\nint numAttributes = classification.getAttributes().size();\r\ndpm.trainClassifier(numAttributes - 1, classifierType.J48);\r\n```\r\nThe model may be directly loaded as well using the _loadModel_ method:\r\n``` java\r\ndpm.loadModel(classifier);\r\n```\r\nNow that the model has been built, this can be evaluated by the method _testClassifier_. A summary about the evaluation may be obtained by _getTestSummary_ method.\r\nThe confusion matrix is obtained using the _getTestConfusionMatrix_ function.\r\n``` java\r\ndpm.testClassifier();\r\nString summaryEvaluation = dpm.getTestSummary();\r\nString confusionMatrix = dpm.getConfusionMatrix();\r\n```\r\nTo convert features vector or features matrix coming from the Feature Extracture\r\nstage into Instances Weka objects, the methods _featureVectorToInstances_ and _featureMatrixToInstances_ are available.\r\n``` java\r\nInstances instances = dpm.featureVectorToInstances(featureVector);\r\nInstances instances = dpm.featureMatrixToInstances(featureMatrix);\r\n```\r\nTo clasify and unlabeled instance, there are two functions available: _classifyInstanceToDouble_ and _classifyInstanceToString_. For example, to classify the first instance of an Instances object called instances:\r\n``` java\r\nString label = dpm.classifyInstanceToString(instances.firstInstance());\r\nDouble label = dpm.classifyInstanceToDouble(instances.firstInstance());\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Online\r\n\r\n##### Acquisition and Segmentation\r\n\r\nThese modules are not used in the online inference knowledge process, due to that\r\nthe Communication Manager is the one which provides the data through windows with\r\na determinate size.\r\n\r\n##### Pre-Processing, Feature Extraction, and Classification\r\n\r\nTo make the online knowledge inference, it is necessary to define the features to\r\nbe extracted. The classification model and the class attribute must be defined as well.\r\nThe previous section, Offine knowledge inference, shows how to do it.\r\nIn order to execute the knowledge inference as a sequence, all the steps are defined under one function:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\ndpm.inferenceOnline(2, sensorsAndDevices, null, 0, 1);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe last parameter indicates which kind the class attribute is (and in consequence the\r\nvalue returned): String or Double. In case the last parameter is 0, the returned value\r\nwill be a String and will be stored in the _stringClassified variable_ (which is defuned in this manager). In case the last parameter is 1 (like in the example), the returned value will be Double and will be stored in the _doubleClassified_ variable (which is also defined in this manager).\r\n\r\nThere is also another function for the online knowledge inference:\r\n``` java\r\ndpm.inferenceOnline(2, sensorsAndDevices, null, 0, 1, mHandler);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contribution guidelines\r\n\r\nHow can you help mHealthDroid to be a more completed tool?

We are looking forward to help you!\r\n\r\n## Inspiration\r\n\r\nThis project is an original idea. It began as the MsC thesis for Computer Engineering of both authors in the University of Granada (UGR). \r\n\r\nAfter a research, we got the conclusion that there exist many wearable health devices, a lot biomedical applications and even a\r\nwide variety of biomedical frameworks and mobile frameworks, but in terms of biomedical mobile frameworks there is only a few and most of them are focused in the acquisition of data, patient monitoring and data broadcasting. We consider quality trustworthy health applications should incorporate these functionalities plus many others such as data visualization, local and remote storage, guidelines, notifications or knowledge inference and should not be limited to a particular biomedical device. For all these reasons the idea of mHealthDroid was born.\r\n\r\n## Copyright and license\r\n\r\nProject released under the license GPL V.3.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
